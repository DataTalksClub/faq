When the troubleshooting guide above does not help resolve it and you need another pair of eyeballs to spot mistakes. When asking a question, include as much information as possible:

What are you coding on? What OS?

What command did you run, which video did you follow? Etc etc

What error did you get? Does it have a line number to the “offending” code and have you check it for typos?

What have you tried that did not work? This answer is crucial as without it, helpers would ask you to do the suggestions in the error log first. Or just read this FAQ document.

The issue was with the network. Google is not accessible in my country, I am using a VPN. And The terminal program does not automatically follow the system proxy and requires separate proxy configuration settings.I opened a Enhanced Mode in Clash, which is a VPN app, and 'terraform apply' works! So if you encounter the same issue, you can ask help for your vpn provider.

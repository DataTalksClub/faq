If you receive the error: “Error 403: The project to be billed is associated with an absent billing account., accountDisabled” It is most likely because you did not enter YOUR project ID. The snip below is from video 1.3.2

The value you enter here will be unique to each student. You can find this value on your GCP Dashboard when you login.

Another possibility is that you have not linked your billing account to your current project

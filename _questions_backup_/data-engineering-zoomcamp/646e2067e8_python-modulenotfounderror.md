ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _sqlite3: The specified module could not be found. ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pysqlite2'

The issue seems to arise from the missing of sqlite3.dll in path ".\Anaconda\Dlls\".

âœ…I solved it by simply copying that .dll file from \Anaconda3\Library\bin and put it under the path mentioned above. (if you are using anaconda)

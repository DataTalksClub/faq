question: Environment - Roadblock for Windows users in modules with *.sh (shell scripts).

Later modules (module-05 & RisingWave workshop) use shell scripts in *.sh files and most Windows users not using WSL would hit a wall and cannot continue, even in git bash or MINGW64. This is why WSL environment setup is recommended from the start.

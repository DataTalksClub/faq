Problem: The February dataset has been used as a validation/test dataset and been stripped of the outliers in a similar manner to the train dataset (taking only the rows for the duration between 1 and 60, inclusive). The RMSE obtained afterward is in the thousands.

Answer: The sparsematrix result from DictVectorizer shouldnâ€™t be turned into an ndarray. After removing that part of the code, I ended up receiving a correct result .

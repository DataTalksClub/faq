Problem: While following the steps in the videos you may have problems trying to download with wget the files. Usually it is a 403 error type (Forbidden access).

Solution: The links point to files on cloudfront.net, something like this:

Iâ€™m not download the dataset directly, i use dataset URL and run this in the file.

Update(27-May-2023): Vikram

I am able to download the data from the below link. This is from the official  NYC trip record page (). Copy link from page directly as the below url might get changed if the NYC decides to move away from this. Go to the page , right click and use copy link.

wget [d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net](https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/green_tripdata_2021-01.parquet)

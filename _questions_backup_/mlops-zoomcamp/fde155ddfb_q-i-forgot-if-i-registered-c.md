Approximately 3 months.

Q: Can I still take this course after the cohort has started (or after the course launch date)?

You don't need to register, registration is not mandatory. It is for gauging the level of interest and collecting data for analytics.
You can also just start learning and submitting homework without registering while a cohort is “live”. It is not checked against any registered list. Registration is just to gauge interest before the start date.

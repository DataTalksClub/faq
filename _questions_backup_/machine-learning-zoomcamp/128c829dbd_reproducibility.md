Problem description:

Do we have to run everything?

You are encouraged, if you can, to run them. As this provides another opportunity to learn from others.

Not everyone will be able to run all the files, in particular the neural networks.

Solution description:

Alternatively, can you see that everything you need to reproduce is there: the dataset is there, the instructions are there, are there any obvious errors and so on.

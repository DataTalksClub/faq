Should we perform EDA on the base of train or train+validation or train+validation+test dataset?

It's indeed good practice to only rely on the train dataset for EDA. Including validation might be okay. But we aren't supposed to touch the test dataset, even just looking at it isn't a good idea. We indeed pretend that this is the future unseen data

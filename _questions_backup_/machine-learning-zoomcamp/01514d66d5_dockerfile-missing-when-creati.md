I had this error when creating a AWS ElasticBean environment: eb create tumor-diagnosis-env

ERROR   Instance deployment: Both 'Dockerfile' and 'Dockerrun.aws.json' are missing in your source bundle. Include at least one of them. The deployment failed.

I did not committed the files used to build the container, particularly the Dockerfile. After a git add and git commit of the modified files, the command works.

When creating and launching an AWS Elastic Bean environment with eb create why does this error show up “ERROR: CommandError - git could not find the HEAD; most likely because there are no commits present”

The error indicates that your project directory has not been initialized as a Git repository or is in a "detached HEAD" state. Elastic Beanstalk's CLI (eb) relies on Git for managing application versions, so resolving this issue is necessary. Here is how you can fix it:

Check if Git is initialized in your project directory by running: git status

If Git is not initialized, you’ll see an error or a message indicating no repository exists. Initialize it: git init

If the Git repository exists but doesn’t have any commits, create an initial commit:

o   git add .

o   git commit -m "Initial commit"

This will allow Elastic Beanstalk to track your project files

If Git reports that it is in a "detached HEAD" state, switch to a valid branch:

o   Create a new branch (if none exists): git checkout -b main

o   Or switch to an existing branch: git checkout main

If the warnings persist, reinitialize Elastic Beanstalk to ensure it’s correctly configured: eb init

Retry the Deployment by running the eb command again: eb create <env_name> --enable-spot

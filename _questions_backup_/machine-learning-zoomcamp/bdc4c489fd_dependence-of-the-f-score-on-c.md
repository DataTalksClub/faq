question: Dependence of the F-score on class imbalance
section: 4. Evaluation Metrics for Classification
sort_order: 1670

Precision-recall curve, and thus the score, explicitly depends on the ratio  of positive to negative test cases. This means that comparison of the F-score across different problems with differing class ratios is problematic. One way to address this issue is to use a standard class ratio  when making such comparisons.

We can use sklearn & numpy packages to calculate Root Mean Squared Error

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

import numpy as np

Rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_pred, y_val/ytest)

You can also refer to Alexeyâ€™s notebook for Week 2:

[GitHub](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/blob/master/chapter-02-car-price/02-carprice.ipynb)

which includes the following code:

def rmse(y, y_pred):

error = y_pred - y

mse = (error ** 2).mean()

return np.sqrt(mse)

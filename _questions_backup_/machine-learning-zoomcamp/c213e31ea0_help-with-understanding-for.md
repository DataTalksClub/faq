question: 'Help with understanding: “For each numerical value, use it as score and
  compute AUC”'

When calculating the ROC AUC score using  the function expects two parameters “y_true” and “y_score”. So for each numerical value in the dataframe it will be passed as the “y_score” to the function and the target variable will get passed a “y_true” each time.

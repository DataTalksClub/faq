Note, that matrix multiplication (matrix-matrix, matrix-vector multiplication) can be written as * operator in some sources, but performed as  operator or  via numpy. * operator performs element-wise multiplication ().

or  can be used, but for matrix-matrix multiplication @ or np.matmul() is preferred (as per numpy ).

The line of code below convert a notebook to python script which will have the same name as the notebook with a .py extension. This should be run on the terminal

jupyter nbconvert --to python notebnook.ipynb

OR on the jupyter notebook

File -> Save and Export Notebook As -> Executable Scripts. This will download the file in the download folder

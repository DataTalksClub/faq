Technically, yes. Advisable? Not really. Reasons:

Some homework(s) asks for specific python library versions.

Answers may not match in MCQ options if using different languages other than Python 3.10 (the recommended version for 2023 cohort)

And as for midterms/capstones, your peer-reviewers may not know these other languages. Do you want to be penalized for others not knowing these other languages?

You can create a separate repo using courseâ€™s lessons but written in other languages for your own learnings, but not advisable for submissions.

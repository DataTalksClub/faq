Embeddings = turning non-numerical data into numerical data, while preserving meaning and context. Similar non-numerical data, when entered into an embedding algorithm, should produce similar numerical data. The similar numerical data being close in mathematical values allows for mathematical semantic similarity algorithms to be leveraged.  See, also, “vector space model” and “dimensionality reduction”.

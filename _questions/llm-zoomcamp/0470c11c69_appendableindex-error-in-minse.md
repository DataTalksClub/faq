question: AppendableIndex error in minsearch (not resolved by upgrading minsearch
  or importing from minsearch.append)
section: 'Workshops: Agents'
sort_order: 840

Error: 'ImportError: cannot import name 'AppendableIndex' from 'minsearch''

Fix:  Rename the previously downloaded minsearch.py file to avoid conflicts, then reinstall minsearch using pip so the import works correctly.

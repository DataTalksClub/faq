Multiple retrieval approaches are evaluated, and the best one is used (2 points)  I am trying to evaluate a project. The person use only minsearch for evaluated but did boosting and got boostin parameter posted. Do they get one mark?

Answer

Here you go:

The evaluation criteria state that to receive 2 points, multiple RAG approaches must be evaluated, and the best one must be used. Since the individual in question is using only minsearch for evaluation, despite applying boosting, this would not qualify as evaluating multiple RAG approaches.

Therefore, they would receive only 1 point for utilizing a single RAG approach (minsearch) in their evaluation, even though they incorporated a boosting parameter. The boosting itself does not constitute a separate approach; it is simply an enhancement applied to the single method being used.

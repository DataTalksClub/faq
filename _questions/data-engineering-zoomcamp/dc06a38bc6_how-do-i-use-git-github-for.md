After you create a GitHub account, you should clone the course repo to your local machine using the process outlined in this video: [Git for Everybody: How to Clone a Repository from GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKcqniGu3tA)

Having this local repository on your computer will make it easy for you to access the instructorsâ€™ code and make pull requests (if you want to add your own notes or make changes to the course content).

You will probably also create your own repositories that host your notes, versions of your file, to do this. Here is a great tutorial that shows you how to do this: [How to Create a Git Repository | Atlassian Git Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository)

Remember to ignore large database, .csv, and .gz files, and other files that should not be saved to a repository. Use .gitignore for this: [.gitignore file - ignoring files in Git | Atlassian Git Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore)

NEVER stores passwords or keys in a git repo (even if that repo is set to private). Put files containing sensitive information (.env, secret.json etc.) in your .gitignore.

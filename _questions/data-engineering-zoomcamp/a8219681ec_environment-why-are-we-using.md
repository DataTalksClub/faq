For uniformity.

You can use other cloud platforms, since you get every service that’s been provided by GCP in Azure and AWS,  you’re not restricted to GCP, you can use other cloud platforms like AWS if you’re comfortable with AWS or others.

Because everyone has a google account, GCP has a free trial period and gives $300 in credits  to new users. Also, we are working with BigQuery, which is a part of GCP.

Note that to sign up for a free GCP account, you must have a valid credit card.

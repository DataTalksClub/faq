question: GCP BQ - Caution in using bigquery:no
sort_order: 2080

Use big queries carefully,

I created by bigquery dataset on an account where my free trial was exhausted, and got a bill of $80.

Use big query in free credits and destroy all the datasets after creation.

Check your Billing daily! Especially if youâ€™ve spinned up a VM.

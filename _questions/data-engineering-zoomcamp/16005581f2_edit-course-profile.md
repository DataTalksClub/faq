The display name listed on the leaderboard is an auto-generated randomized name. You can edit it to be a nickname, or your real name, if you prefer. Your entry on the Leaderboard is the one highlighted in light green.

The Certificate name should be your actual name that you want to appear on your certificate after completing the course.

The "Display on Leaderboard" option indicates whether you want your name to be listed on the course leaderboard.

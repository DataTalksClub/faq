If docker ps doesn’t show pgdatabase running, run: docker ps -a

This should show all containers, either running or stopped.

Get the container id for pgdatabase-1, and run

After executing `docker-compose up` - if you lose database data and are unable to successfully execute your Ingestion script (to re-populate your database) but receive the following error:

sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (psycopg2.OperationalError) could not translate host name /data_pgadmin:/var/lib/pgadmin"pg-database" to address: Name or service not known

Docker compose is creating its own default network since it is no longer specified in a docker execution command or file. Docker Compose will emit to logs the new network name. See the logs after executing `docker compose up` to find the network name and change the network name argument in your Ingestion script.

If problems persist with pgcli, we can use HeidiSQL

The zoom link is only published to instructors/presenters/TAs.

Students participate via Youtube Live and submit questions to Slido (link would be pinned in the chat when Alexey goes Live). The video URL should be posted in the announcements channel on  &  and is in  before it begins. Also, you will see it live on the DataTalksClub .

Don’t post your questions in chat as it would be off-screen before the instructors/moderators have a chance to answer it if the room is very active.

Solution: proceed with setting up serving_dir on your computer as in the extract_model.md file. Then instead of

docker pull tensorflow/serving

use

docker pull emacski/tensorflow-serving

Then

docker run -p 8500:8500 -p 8501:8501 --mount type=bind,source=`pwd`/serving_dir/tip_model,target=/models/tip_model -e MODEL_NAME=tip_model -t emacski/tensorflow-serving

Then run the curl command as written, and you should get a prediction.

The reason this video about the GCP VM exists is that many students had problems configuring their env. You can use your own env if it works for you.

And the advantage of using your own environment is that if you are working in a Github repo where you can commit, you will be able to commit the changes that you do. In the VM the repo is cloned via HTTPS so it is not possible to directly commit, even if you are the owner of the repo.

The docker will keep on crashing continuously

Not working after restart

docker engine stopped

And failed to fetch extensions pop ups will on screen non-stop

Solution :

Try checking if latest version of docker is installed / Try updating the docker

If Problem still persist then final solution is to reinstall docker

(Just have to fetch images again else no issues)

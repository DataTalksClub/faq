Yes, you can. Just remember to adapt all the information on the videos to AWS. Besides, the final capstone will be evaluated based on the task: Create a data pipeline! Develop a visualisation!

The problem would be when you need help. Youâ€™d need to rely on fellow coursemates who also use AWS (or have experience using it before), which might be in smaller numbers than those learning the course with GCP.

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides two free trial options: the Free Trial and the Sandbox. Note that users can switch from Sandbox to Free Trial anytime by adding billing details. The reverse is true at anytime as well. You can switch from the GCP Free Trial to the Sandbox option. To do this, you'll need to disable billing on your project. Once billing is disabled, your project will revert to the Sandbox mode, allowing you to use the limited free resources without a billing account.

However, completing the course using the GCP Sandbox option is not possible because the Sandbox has limited features compared to the full Free Trial with $300 credit. The course will involve using services that are not available in the Sandbox environment. The FAQ indicates that while the course may start locally, it will eventually transition to using VMs, GCS Bucket and other paid services on on GCP, which would require the full capabilities provided by the $300 credit option. Additionally, the course emphasizes the use of BigQuery, which is a key component of GCP, and the Sandbox may not support all necessary functionalities for working with it effectively. Therefore, it's recommended to utilize the full Free Trial with billing details to ensure access to all required features for the course.

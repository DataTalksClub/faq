Cause:

It happens because the apps are not updated. To be specific, search for any pending updates for Windows Terminal, WSL and Windows Security updates.

Solution

for updating Windows terminal which worked for me:

Go to Microsoft Store.

Go to the library of apps installed in your system.

Search for Windows terminal.

Update the app and restart your system to  see the changes.

For updating the Windows security updates:

Go to Windows updates and check if there are any pending updates from Windows, especially security updates.

Do restart your system once the updates are downloaded and installed successfully.unexpectedly

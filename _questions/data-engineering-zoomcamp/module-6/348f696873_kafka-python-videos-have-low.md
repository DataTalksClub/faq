question: Kafka - python videos have low audio and hard to follow up
sort_order: 4000

tip:As the videos have low audio so I downloaded them and used VLC media player with putting the audio to the max 200% of original audio and the audio became quite good or try to use auto caption generated on Youtube directly.

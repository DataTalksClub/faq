Instead of using “localhost” as the host name/address, try “postgres”, or “host.docker.internal” instead

Alternative Solution: For those having installed postgres locally and disabling persist data on postgres-container in docker i.e. volume: removed, remember to use postgres port other than 5432 (e.g. 5433 is usable). And for pgadmin host name/address, if localhost, postgres, and host.docker.internal is not working, you can use your own IPv4 Address which can be found in Windows OS via: Command Prompt > ipconfig > Under Wireless LAN adapter WiFi 2. E.g.:

IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.148

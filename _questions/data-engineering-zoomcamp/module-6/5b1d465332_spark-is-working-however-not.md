Since we used multiple notebooks during the course, it's possible that there are more than one Spark session active. Itâ€™s highly likely that you are observing the incorrect one. Follow these steps to troubleshoot:

Spark uses port 4040 by default, but if more than one session is active, it will try to use the next available port (e.g., 4041).

Ensure you're viewing the correct Spark Web UI for the application where your jobs are running.

Verify the current application session address:

Eg: Using spark.sparkContext.uiWebUrl command in your session.

Expected output: [http://your.application.session.address.internal:4041](http://spark-exec.southamerica-east1-c.c.de-zoomcamp-25-449418.internal:4041/)

Indicating port 4041

If using a VM, make sure you forward the identified port to access the web ui on the localhost:<port>.

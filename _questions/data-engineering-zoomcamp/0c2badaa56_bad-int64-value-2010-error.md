You might encounter this when building the fact_trips.sql model. The issue may be with the payment_type_description field.

Using safe_cast as above, would cause the entire field to become null. A better approach is to drop the offending decimal place, then cast to integer.

cast(replace({{ payment_type }},'.0','') as integer)

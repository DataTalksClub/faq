You can set it up on your laptop or PC if you prefer to work locally from your laptop or PC.

You might face some challenges, especially for Windows users.

If you prefer to work on the local machine, you may start with the week 1 Introduction to Docker and follow through.

However, if you prefer to set up a virtual machine, you may start with these first:

Using GitHub Codespaces

I decided to work on a virtual machine because I have different laptops & PCs for my home & office, so I can work on this boot camp virtually anywhere.

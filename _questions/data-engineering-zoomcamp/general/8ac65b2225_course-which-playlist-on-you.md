All the main videos are stored in the Main “DATA ENGINEERING ZOOMCAMP” playlist (no year specified). The Github repository has also been updated (if not create a pull request) to show each video with a thumbnail, that would bring you directly to the same playlist below.

Below is the MAIN PLAYLIST’. And then you refer to the year specific playlist for additional videos for that year like for office hours videos etc. Also find this playlist pinned to the slack channel.

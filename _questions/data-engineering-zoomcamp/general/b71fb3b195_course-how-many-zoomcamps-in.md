question: Course - how many Zoomcamps in a year?
sort_order: 60
---

There are multiple Zoomcamps in a year, as of 2025. More info at [DTC Article](https://datatalks.club/blog/guide-to-free-online-courses-at-datatalks-club.html).

However, they are five separate courses, estimated to be during these months:

Data-Engineering (Jan - Apr)

Stock Market Analytics (Apr - May)

MLOps (May - Aug)

LLM (June - Sep)

Machine Learning (Sep - Jan)

There's only one Data-Engineering Zoomcamp “live” cohort per year, for the certification. Same as for the other Zoomcamps.

They follow pretty much the same schedule for each cohort per zoomcamp. For Data-Engineering it is (generally) from Jan-Apr of the year. If you’re not interested in the Certificate, you can take any zoom camps at any time, at your own pace, out of sync with any “live” cohort.

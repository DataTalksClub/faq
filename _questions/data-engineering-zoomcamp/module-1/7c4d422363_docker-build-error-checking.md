Found the issue in the PopOS linux. It happened because our user didn’t have authorization rights to the host folder ( which also caused folder seems empty, but it didn’t!).

✅Solution:

Just add permission for everyone to th

777 <path_to_folder>

Example:

sudo chmod -R 777 ny_taxi_postgres_data/

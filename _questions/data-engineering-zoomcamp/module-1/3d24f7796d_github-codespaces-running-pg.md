With the default instructions and running pgadmin in docker you may receive a blank screen after logging in to the pgadmin console. To resolve this, add the following two environment variables to your pgadmin config to allow it to work with codespaceâ€™s reverse proxy:

PGADMIN_CONFIG_PROXY_X_HOST_COUNT: 1PGADMIN_CONFIG_PROXY_X_PREFIX_COUNT: 1

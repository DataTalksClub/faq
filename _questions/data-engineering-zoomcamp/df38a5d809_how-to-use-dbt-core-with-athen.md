If you donâ€™t have access to dbt Cloud which is already natively being supported by AWS, refer here:,,, &, you can use the community built for dbt-Core.

Key Features

Allows data transformation using CREATE TABLE AS or CREATE VIEW SQL queries

Not yet supported features:

Python models

Persisting documentation for views

This adapter can be a valuable resource for those who need to work with Athena using dbt Core, and I hope this entry can help others discover it.

question: Can install Faust Library for Module 6 Python Version due to dependency
  conflicts?
section: 'Module 6: streaming with kafka'
sort_order: 4090

The Faust repository and library is no longer maintained -

If you do not know Java, you now have the option to follow the Python Videos 6.13 & 6.14 here   and follow the RedPanda Python version here  - NOTE: I highly recommend watching the Java videos to understand the concept of streaming but you can skip the coding parts - all will become clear when you get to the Python videos and RedPanda files.

The Faust repository and library is no longer maintained - [https://github.com/robinhood/faust](https://github.com/robinhood/faust)

If you do not know Java, you now have the option to follow the Python Videos 6.13 & 6.14 here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgAlVknDFlQ&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgAlVknDFlQ&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=80)  and follow the RedPanda Python version here [https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/06-streaming/python/redpanda_example](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/06-streaming/python/redpanda_example) - NOTE: I highly recommend watching the Java videos to understand the concept of streaming but you can skip the coding parts - all will become clear when you get to the Python videos and RedPanda files.

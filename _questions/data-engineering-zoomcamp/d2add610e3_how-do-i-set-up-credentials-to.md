You can set up credentials for `dlt` in several ways. Here are the two most common methods:

Environment Variables (Easiest)

Set credentials via environment variables. For example, to configure Google Cloud credentials:

This method avoids hardcoding secrets in your code and works seamlessly with most environments.

Configuration Files (Recommended for Local Use)

Use `.dlt/secrets.toml` for sensitive credentials and `.dlt/config.toml` for non-sensitive configurations.

Example for Google Cloud in `secrets.toml`:

Place these files in the .dlt folder of your project.

Additional Notes:

Never commit secrets.toml to version control (add it to .gitignore).

Credentials can also be loaded via vaults, AWS Parameter Store, or custom setups.

For additional methods and detailed information, refer to the [official dlt documentation](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/credentials/)

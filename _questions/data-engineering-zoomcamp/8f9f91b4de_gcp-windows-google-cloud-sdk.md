for windows if you having trouble install SDK try follow these steps on the link, if you getting this error:

These credentials will be used by any library that requests Application Default Credentials (ADC).

WARNING:

Cannot find a quota project to add to ADC. You might receive a "quota exceeded" or "API not enabled" error. Run $ gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project to add a quota project.

For me:

I reinstalled the sdk using unzip file “install.bat”,

after successfully checking gcloud version,

run gcloud init to set up project before

you run gcloud auth application-default login

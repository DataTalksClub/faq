Actually Spark SQL is one independent “type” of SQL - Spark SQL.

The several SQL providers are very similar:

SELECT [attributes]

FROM [table]

WHERE [filter]

GROUP BY [grouping attributes]

HAVING [filtering the groups]

ORDER BY [attribute to order]

(INNER/FULL/LEFT/RIGHT) JOIN [table2]

ON [attributes table joining table2] (...)

What differs the most between several SQL providers are built-in functions.

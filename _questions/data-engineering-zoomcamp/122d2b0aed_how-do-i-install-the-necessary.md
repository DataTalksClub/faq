Answer: To run the provided code, ensure that the 'dlt[duckdb]' package is installed. You can do this by executing the provided installation command in a jupyter notebook: !pip install dlt[duckdb]. If you’re doing it locally, be sure to also have duckdb pip installed (even before the duckdb package is loaded).

in zsh try:
pip install “dlt[duckdb]”

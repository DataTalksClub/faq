RuntimeWarning: As the c extension couldn't be imported, google-crc32c is using a pure python implementation that is significantly slower. If possible, please configure a c build environment and compile extention warnings.warn(_SLOW_CRC32C_WARNING, RuntimeWarning)

Failed to upload ./yellow_tripdata_2024-01.parquet to GCS: Timeout of 120.0s exceeded, last exception: ('Connection aborted.', timeout('The write operation timed out'))

Failed to upload ./yellow_tripdata_2024-03.parquet to GCS: Timeout of 120.0s exceeded, last exception: ('Connection aborted.', timeout('The write operation timed out'))

Im facing two separate issues in my script:

google-crc32c Warning: The Google Cloud Storage library is using a slow Python implementation instead of the optimized C version.

Upload Timeout Error: Your file uploads are timing out after 120 seconds.

✅ Solution: Install the C-optimized google-crc32c

pip install --upgrade google-crc32c

2. Fix Google Cloud Storage Upload Timeout

✅ Solution 1: Increase Timeout

blob.upload_from_filename(file_path, timeout=300) # Set timeout to 5 minutes

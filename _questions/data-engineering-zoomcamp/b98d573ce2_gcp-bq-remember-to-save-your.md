By the way, this isnâ€™t a problem/solution, but a useful hint:

Please, remember to save your progress in BigQuery SQL Editor.

I was almost finishing the homework, when my Chrome Tab froze and I had to reload it. Then I lost my entire SQL script.

Save your script from time to time. Just click on the button at the top bar. Your saved file will be available on the left panel.

Alternatively, you can copy paste your queries into an .sql file in your preferred editor (Notepad++, VS Code, etc.). Using the .sql extension will provide convenient color formatting.

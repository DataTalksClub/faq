Sometimes, when you try to restart a docker image configured with a network name, the above message appears. In this case, use the following command with the appropriate container name:>>> If the container is running state, use docker stop <container_name>>>> then, docker rm pg-databaseOr use docker start instead of docker run in order to restart the docker image without removing it.

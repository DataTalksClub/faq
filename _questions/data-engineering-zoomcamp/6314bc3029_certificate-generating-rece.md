Q: When will it be sent out / released?

Q: How do I get my certificate after project(s) have been reviewed and graded?

A: There’ll be an announcement in Telegram and the course channel for

(1) checking that your proper full name is how you want displayed on the Certificate (see Editing course profile on the Course Management webpage), and

(2)  when the grading is completed.

After the second announcement, please follow instructions in [[GitHub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/certificates.md)](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/certificates.md) on how to generate the Certificate document yourself.

We have a backup, so use it instead: [[GitHub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data)](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data)r

So the link should be [[GitHub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz)](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz)

Note: Make sure to [unzip the “gz” file](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-unzip-gz-file/) (no, the “unzip” command won’t work for this.)

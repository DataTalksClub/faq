This feature is only available for dbt repositories connected through dbt Cloud's native integration with Github, Gitlab, or Azure DevOps

Solution: Contrary to the [guide on DTC repo](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/04-analytics-engineering/dbt_cloud_setup.md), donâ€™t use the Git Clone option. Use the Github one instead. Step-by-step guide to UN-LINK Git Clone and RE-LINK with Github in the next entry below

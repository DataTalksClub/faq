Yes, the slack channel remains open and you can ask questions there. But always search the channel first and second, check the FAQ (this document), most likely all your questions are already answered here.

You can also tag the bot @ZoomcampQABot to help you conduct the search, but donâ€™t rely on its answers 100%, it is pretty good though.

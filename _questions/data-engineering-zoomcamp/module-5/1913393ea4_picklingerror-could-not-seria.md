This version combination worked for me:

PySpark = 3.3.2Pandas = 1.5.3If it still has an error,

Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling o180.showString. : org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 6.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 0.0 in stage 6.0 (TID 6) (host.docker.internal executor driver): org.apache.spark.SparkException: Python worker failed to connect back.

Run this before SparkSession

import os

import sys

os.environ['PYSPARK_PYTHON'] = sys.executable

os.environ['PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON'] = sys.executable

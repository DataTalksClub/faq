Each submitted project will be evaluated by 3 (three) randomly assigned students that have also submitted the project.

You will also be responsible for grading the projects from 3 fellow students yourself. Please be aware that: not complying to this rule also implies you failing to achieve the Certificate at the end of the course.

The final grade you get will be the median score of the grades you get from the peer reviewers.

And of course, the peer review criteria for evaluating or being evaluated must follow the guidelines defined .

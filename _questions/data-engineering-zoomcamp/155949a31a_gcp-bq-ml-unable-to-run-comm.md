Issue: Tried running command to export ML model from BQ to GCS from Week 3

bq --project_id taxi-rides-ny extract -m nytaxi.tip_model gs://taxi_ml_model/tip_model

It is failing on following error:

Solution:  Please enter correct project_id and gcs_bucket folder address. My gcs_bucket folder address is

gs://dtc_data_lake_optimum-airfoil-376815/tip_model

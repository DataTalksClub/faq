I found out that the easies way to upload datasets form github for the homework is utilising this script [git_csv_to_gcs.py](https://github.com/inner-outer-space/de-zoomcamp-2024/blob/main/4-analytics-engineering/git_csv_to_gcs.py). Thank you Lidia!!It is similar to a script that Alexey provided us in 03-data-warehouse/extras/web_to_gcs.py

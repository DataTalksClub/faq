Situation: in VS Code, usually there will be a triangle icon next to each test. I couldn’t see it at first and had to do some fixes.

Solution:

()

VS Code

→ Explorer (first icon on the left navigation bar)

→ JAVA PROJECTS (bottom collapsable)

→  icon next in the rightmost position to JAVA PROJECTS

→  clean Workspace

→ Confirm by clicking Reload and Delete

Now you will be able to see the triangle icon next to each test like what you normally see in python tests.

E.g.:

You can also add classes and packages in this window instead of creating files in the project directory

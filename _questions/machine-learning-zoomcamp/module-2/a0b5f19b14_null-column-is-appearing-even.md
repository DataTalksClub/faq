When creating a duplicate of your dataframe by doing the following:

X_train = df_train

X_val = df_val

You’re still referencing the original variable, this is called a shallow copy. You can make sure that no references are attaching both variables and still keep the copy of the data do the following to create a deep copy:

X_train = df_train.copy()

X_val = df_val.copy()

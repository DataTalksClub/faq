Question: Regarding RMSE, how do we decide on the correct score to choose? In the study group discussion    about week two homework, all of us got it wrong and one person had the lowest score selected as well.

Answer: You need to find RMSE for each alpha. If RMSE scores  are equal, you will select the lowest alpha.

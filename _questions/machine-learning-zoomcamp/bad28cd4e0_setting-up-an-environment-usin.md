I found this video quite helpful: [Creating Virtual Environment for Python from VS Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h9w0meM8i4)

[Native Jupiter Notebooks support in VS Code] In VS Code you can also have a native Jupiter Notebooks support, i.e. you do not need to open a web browser to code in a Notebook. If you have port forwarding enabled + run a ‘jupyter notebook ‘ command from a remote machine + have a remote connection configured in .ssh/config (as Alexey’s [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSiYkP23zo) suggests) - VS Code can execute remote Jupyter Notebooks files on a remote server from your local machine: [[code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

[Git support from VS Code] You can work with Github from VSCode - staging and commits are easy from the VS Code’s UI:

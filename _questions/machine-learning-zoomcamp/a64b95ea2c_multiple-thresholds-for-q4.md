I am getting multiple thresholds with the same F1 score, does this indicate I am doing something wrong or is there a method for choosing? I would assume just pick the lowest?

Choose the one closest to any of the options

You can always use scikit-learn (or other standard libraries/packages) to verify results obtained using your own code, e.g. you can use  “classification_report” ([[scikit-learn.org](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html)) to obtain precision, recall and F1-score.

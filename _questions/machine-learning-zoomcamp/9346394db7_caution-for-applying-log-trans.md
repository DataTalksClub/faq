question: Caution for applying log transformation in Week-2 2023 cohort homework
section: 2. Machine Learning for Regression

The instruction for applying log transformation to the ‘median_house_value’ variable is provided before Q3 in the homework for Week-2 under the ‘Prepare and split the dataset’ heading.

However, this instruction is absent in the subsequent questions of the homework, and I got stuck with Q5 for a long time, trying to figure out why my RMSE was so huge, when it clicked to me that I forgot to apply log transformation to the target variable. Please remember to apply log transformation to the target variable for each question.

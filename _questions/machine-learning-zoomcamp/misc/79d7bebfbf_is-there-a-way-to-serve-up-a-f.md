Yes, you can create a mobile app or interface that manages these forms and validations. But you should also perform validations on backend.

You can also check Streamlit: [https://github.com/DataTalksClub/project-of-the-week/blob/main/2022-08-14-frontend.md](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/project-of-the-week/blob/main/2022-08-14-frontend.md)

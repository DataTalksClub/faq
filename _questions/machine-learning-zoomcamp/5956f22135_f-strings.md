f-String not properly keyed in: does anyone knows why i am getting error after import pickle?

The first error showed up because your f-string is using () instead of {} around C. So, should be: f’model_C={C}.bin’

The second error as noticed by Sriniketh, your are missing one parenthesis it should be pickle.dump((dv, model), f_out)

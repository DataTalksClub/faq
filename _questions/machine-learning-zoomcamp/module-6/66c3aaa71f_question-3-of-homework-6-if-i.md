question: Question 3 of homework 6 if i see that rmse goes up at a certain number
  of n_estimators but then goes back down lower than it was before, should the answer
  be the number of n_estimators after which rmse initially went up, or the number
  after which it was its overall lowest value?
sort_order: 2520

When rmse stops improving means, when it stops to decrease or remains almost similar.

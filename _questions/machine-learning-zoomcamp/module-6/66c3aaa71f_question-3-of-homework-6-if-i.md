question: 'Homework: Question 3 of homework 6 if I see that RMSE goes up at a certain
  number of `n_estimators` but then goes back down lower than it was before, should
  the answer be the number of `n_estimators` after which RMSE initially went up, or
  the number after which it was its overall lowest value?'

When RMSE stops improving, it means when it stops decreasing or remains nearly the same.

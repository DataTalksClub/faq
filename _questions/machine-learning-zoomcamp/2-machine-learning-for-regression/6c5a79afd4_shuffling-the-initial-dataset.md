question: Shuffling the initial dataset using pandas built-in function
sort_order: 750
---

It is possible to do the shuffling of the dataset with the pandas built-in function [pandas.DataFrame.sample](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sample.html).The complete dataset can be shuffled including resetting the index with the following commands:

Setting frac=1 will result in returning a shuffled version of the complete Dataset.

Setting random_state=seed will result in the same randomization as used in the course resources.

df_shuffled = df.sample(frac=1, random_state=seed)

df_shuffled.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

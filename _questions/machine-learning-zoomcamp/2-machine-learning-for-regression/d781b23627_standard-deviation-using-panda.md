question: Standard deviation using Pandas built in Function
sort_order: 880

In pandas you can use built in Pandas function names std() to get standard deviation. For example

df['column_name'].std() to get standard deviation of that column.

df[['column_1', 'column_2']].std() to get standard deviation of multiple columns.

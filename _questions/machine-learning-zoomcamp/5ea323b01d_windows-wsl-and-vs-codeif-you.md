question: Windows WSL and VS CodeIf you have a Windows 11 device and would like to
  use the built in WSL to access linux you can use the Microsoft Learn link [Set up
  a WSL development environment | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment).
  To connect this to VS Code download the Microsoft verified VS Code extension ‘WSL’
  this will allow you to remotely connect to your WSL Ubuntu instance as if it was
  a virtual machine.

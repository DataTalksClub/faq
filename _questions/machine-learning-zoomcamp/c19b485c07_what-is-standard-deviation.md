One of the most important characteristics of the normal distribution is that mean=median=mode, this means that the most popular value, the mean of the distribution and 50% of the sample are under the same value, this is equivalent to say that the area under the curve (black) is the same on the left and on the right. The long tail (red curve) is the result of having a few observations with high values, now the behaviour of the distribution changes, first of all, the area is different on each side and now the mean, median and mode are different. As a consequence, the mean is no longer representative, the range is larger than before and the probability of being on the left or on the right is not the same.

In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. [] The formula to calculate standard deviation is:

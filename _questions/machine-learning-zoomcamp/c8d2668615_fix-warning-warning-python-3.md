This is due to the fact the Pipfile is expecting Python 3.12, but the local container is probably running an older version (mainly the one shown in video , which is Python 3.8.12-slim. In order to fix this simply the `Dockerfile` to run an appropriate version, like shown below:

FROM python:3.12.7-slim

Both python versions (local version, shown in Pipfile and container version) must be congruent so as to guarantee compatibility.

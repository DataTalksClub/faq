A sparse matrix is more memory-efficient because it only stores the non-zero values and their positions in memory. This is particularly useful when working with large datasets with many zero or missing values.

The default DictVectorizer configuration is a sparse matrix. For week3 Q6 using the default sparse is an interesting option because of the size of the matrix. Training the model was also more performant and didnâ€™t give an error message like dense mode.

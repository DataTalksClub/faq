You need to add gunicorn and flask just to be safe to Pipfile with nano Pipfile.add[[source]]

url = "[pypi.org](https://pypi.org/simple")

verify_ssl = true

name = "pypi"

[packages]

scikit-learn = "==1.5.2"

gunicorn = "*"

flask     = “*”

[dev-packages]

[requires]

python_version = "3.11"

After that run pipenv lock then do the docker build -t [name] .  and docker run [name]

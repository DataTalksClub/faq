Question: Could you please help me with HW3 Q3: "Calculate the mutual information score with the (binarized) price for the categorical variable that we have. Use the training set only." What is the second variable that we need to use to calculate the mutual information score?

Answer: You need to calculate the mutual info score between the binarized price (above_average) variable & ocean_proximity, the only original categorical variable in the dataset.

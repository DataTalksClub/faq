When encountering convergence errors during the training of a Ridge regression model, consider the following steps:

Feature Normalization: Normalize your numerical features using techniques like MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler. This ensures that numerical features are on a 	similar scale, preventing convergence issues.

Categorical Feature Encoding: If your dataset includes categorical features, apply 	categorical encoding techniques such as OneHotEncoder (OHE) to 	convert them into a numerical format. OHE is commonly used to represent categorical variables as binary vectors, making them compatible with regression models like Ridge.

Combine Features: After 	normalizing numerical features and encoding categorical features using OneHotEncoder, combine them to form a single feature matrix (X_train). This combined dataset serves as the input for training the Ridge regression model.

By following these steps, you can address convergence errors and enhance the stability of your Ridge model training process. It's important to note that the choice of encoding method, such as OneHotEncoder, is appropriate for handling categorical features in this context.

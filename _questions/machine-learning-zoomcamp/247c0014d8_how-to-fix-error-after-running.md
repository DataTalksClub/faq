<{IMAGE:image_1}>

Solution

This error was because there was another instance of gunicorn running. So I thought of removing this along with the zoomcamp_test image. However, it didnâ€™t let me remove the orphan container. So I did the following

Running the following commands

docker ps -a <to list all docker containers>

docker images <to list images>

docker stop <container ID>

docker rm <container ID>

docker rmi image

I rebuilt the Docker image, and ran it once again; this time it worked correctly and I was able to serve the test script to the endpoint.

I am getting this error message when I tried to install tflite in a pipenv environment

Error:  An error occurred while installing tflite_runtime!

Error text:

ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tflite_runtime (from versions: none)

ERROR: No matching distribution found for tflite_runtime

This version of tflite do not run on python 3.10, the way we can make it work is by install python 3.9, after that it would install the tflite_runtime without problem.

Check all available versions here:

[https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/tflite-runtime/](https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/tflite-runtime/)

If you donâ€™t find a combination matching your setup, try out the options at

[https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/tree/main/tflite](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/tree/main/tflite)

which you can install as shown in the lecture, e.g.

pip install [GitHub](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/raw/main/tflite/tflite_runtime-2.7.0-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl)

Finally, if nothing works, use the TFLite included in TensorFlow for local development, and use Docker for testing Lambda.

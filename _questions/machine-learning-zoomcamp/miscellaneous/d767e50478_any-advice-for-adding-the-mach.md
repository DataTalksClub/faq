  profile?

I’ve seen LinkedIn users list DataTalksClub as Experience with titles as:

Machine Learning Fellow

Machine Learning Student

Machine Learning Participant

Machine Learning Trainee

Please note it is best advised that you do not list the experience as an official “job” or “internship” experience since DataTalksClub did not hire you, nor financially compensate you.

Other ways you can incorporate the experience in the following sections:

Organizations

Projects

Skills

Featured

Original posts

Certifications

Courses

Interesting question, I put the link of my project into my CV as showcase and make posts to show my progress.

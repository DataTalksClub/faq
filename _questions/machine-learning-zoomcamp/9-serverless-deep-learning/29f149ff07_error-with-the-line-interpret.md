question: Error with the line “interpreter.set_tensor(input_index, X”)

I had this error when running the command line : interpreter.set_tensor(input_index, x) that can be seen in the video 9.3 around 12 minutes.

ValueError: Cannot set tensor: Got value of type UINT8 but expected type FLOAT32 for input 0, name: serving_default_conv2d_input:0

This is because the X is an int but a float is expected.

Solution:

I found this solution from this question here [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76102508/valueerror-cannot-set-tensor-got-value-of-type-float64-but-expected-type-float](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76102508/valueerror-cannot-set-tensor-got-value-of-type-float64-but-expected-type-float) :

# Need to convert to float32 before set_tensor

X = np.float32(X)

Then, it works. I work with tensorflow 2.15.0, maybe the fact that this version is more recent involves this change ?

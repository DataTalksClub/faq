When trying to run the command  !ls -lh in windows jupyter notebook  , I was getting an error message that says â€œ'ls' is not recognized as an internal or external command,operable program or batch file.

Solution description :

Instead of !ls -lh , you can use this command !dir , and you will get similar output

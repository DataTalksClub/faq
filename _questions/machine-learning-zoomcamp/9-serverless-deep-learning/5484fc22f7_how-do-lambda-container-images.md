I wanted to understand how lambda container images work in depth and how lambda functions are initialized, for this reason, I found the following documentation

[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html)

[docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-api.html)

This error is produced sometimes when building your docker image from the Amazon python base image.

Solution description: The following could solve the problem.

Update your docker desktop if you havenâ€™t done so.

Or restart docker desktop and terminal and then build the image all over again.

Or if all else fails, first run the following command: DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0  docker build .  then build your image.

Q: How can I deploy a machine learning model using AWS Lambda and API Gateway?To deploy a machine learning model using AWS Lambda and API Gateway, follow these steps:

Prepare the Code for Lambda: Start by developing and testing your machine learning model (e.g., using TensorFlow Lite) locally. Ensure the model is optimized for serverless execution.

Use AWS Lambda: AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can upload your code, which may include the model, dependencies, and necessary libraries.

Prepare a Docker Image (Optional): If your model requires custom dependencies or environments, you can package your application in a Docker image, upload it to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and then link it to AWS Lambda.

Create the Lambda Function: After preparing your code or Docker image, create a Lambda function that will process the requests and return results.

Expose the Lambda Function using API Gateway: Set up an API Gateway to expose the Lambda function as a RESTful endpoint. This allows you to interact with your model via HTTP requests.

By following these steps, you can deploy and expose your machine learning model in a scalable and efficient serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.

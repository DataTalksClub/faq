If you’re struggling to get a Jupyter notebook running locally on your machine, or you have some other issue preventing you from using it (perhaps you’ve only got a cellphone to do your homework with at the moment?) then other online platforms you can consider as a stop gap measure which don’t require anything to be installed are:

JupyterLab [https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/)

JupyterLite [https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/lab/index.html](https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/lab/index.html)

Replit [https://replit.com/](https://replit.com/)

Google Colab [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)

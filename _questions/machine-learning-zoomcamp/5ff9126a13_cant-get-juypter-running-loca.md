If you’re struggling to get a Jupyter notebook running locally on your machine, or you have some other issue preventing you from using it (perhaps you’ve only got a cellphone to do your homework with at the moment?) then other online platforms you can consider as a stop gap measure which don’t require anything to be installed are:

JupyterLab

JupyterLite

Replit

Google Colab

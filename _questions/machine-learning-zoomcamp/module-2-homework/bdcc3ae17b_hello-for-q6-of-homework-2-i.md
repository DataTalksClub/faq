 Mine
  is about 12.4 different from the closets option, but all the above questions I have
  pretty close answers, so I don’t know why there is such a great difference in Q6…

For questions 5 and 6, do not forget to reinitialize:

Idx = np.arange(n)

For each iteration of r in question 5 and also for question 6

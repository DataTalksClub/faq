Should correlation be calculated after splitting or before splitting. And lastly I know how to find the correlation but how do i find the two most correlated features.

Answer: Correlation matrix of your train dataset. Thus, after splitting. Two most correlated features are the ones having the highest correlation coefficient in terms of absolute values.

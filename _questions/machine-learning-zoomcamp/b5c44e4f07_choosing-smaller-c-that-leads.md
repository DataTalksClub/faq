Warning: When searching for the best value of C that yields the highest accuracy, be mindful that you should be looking for the maximum accuracy, not the minimum. Although the goal is to find the smallest C value, ensure that it corresponds to the highest accuracy achieved. Always prioritize accuracy maximization while minimizing C.

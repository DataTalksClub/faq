I was getting the error on client side with this

Client Side:

File "C:\python\lib\site-packages\urllib3\connectionpool.py", line 703, in urlopen …………………..

raise ConnectionError(err, request=request)

requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response'))

Sevrer Side:

It showed error for gunicorn

The waitress  cmd was running smoothly from server side

Solution:

Use the ip-address as 0.0.0.0:8000 or 0.0.0.0:9696.They are the ones which do work max times

Pytorch is also a deep learning framework that allows to do equivalent tasks as keras. Here is a tutorial to create a CNN from scratch using pytorch :

The functions have similar goals. The syntax can be slightly different. For the lessons and the homework, we use keras, but one can feel free to make a pull request with the equivalent with pytorch for lessons and homework!

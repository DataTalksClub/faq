Answer: Ideally midterms up to module-06, capstones include all modules in that cohortâ€™s syllabus. But you can include anything  to feature. Just be sure to document anything not covered in class.

Also watch office hours from previous cohorts. Go to DTC youtube channel and click on Playlists and search for {course yyyy}. ML Zoomcamp was first launched in 2021.

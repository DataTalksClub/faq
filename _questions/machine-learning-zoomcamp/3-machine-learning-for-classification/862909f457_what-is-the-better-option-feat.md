sort_order: 1280

These both methods receive the dictionary as an input. While the DictVectorizer will store the big vocabulary and takes more memory. FeatureHasher create a vectors with predefined length. They are both used for categorical features.

When you have a high cardinality for categorical features better to use FeatureHasher. If you want to preserve feature names in transformed data and have a small number of unique values is DictVectorizer. But your choice will dependence on your data.You can read more by follow the link [scikit-learn.org](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/text/plot_hashing_vs_dict_vectorizer.html)

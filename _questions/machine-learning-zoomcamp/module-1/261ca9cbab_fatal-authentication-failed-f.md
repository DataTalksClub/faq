I had a problem when I tried to push my code from Git Bash:

remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.

remote: Please see [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls) for information on currently recommended modes of authentication.

fatal: Authentication failed for '[https://github.com/username](https://github.com/username)

Solution:

Create a personal access token from your github account and use it when you make a push of your last changes.

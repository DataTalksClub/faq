question: The course videos are from the previous iteration. Will you release new
  ones or we’ll use the videos from 2021?

We won’t re-record the course videos. The focus of the course and the skills we want to teach remained the same, and the videos are still up-to-date.

If you haven’t taken part in the previous iteration, you can start watching the videos. It’ll be useful for you and you will learn new things. However, we recommend using Python 3.10 now instead of Python 3.8.

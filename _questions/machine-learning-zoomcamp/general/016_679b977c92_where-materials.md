- All course materials live in the main ML Zoomcamp GitHub repository: https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/
- Modules are folders for each unit, with a README/markdown per unit, plus videos and notes.
- Cohort-specific items (homework and dates) are under cohorts/2025/.
- The YouTube playlist "Machine Learning Zoomcamp" contains all lessons.
- For quick access, browse the repo, check the modules folders, and look in cohorts/2025 for cohort-specific items. The syllabus is also available at mlzoomcamp.com/#syllabus.

question: Where is the Python TensorFlow template on Saturn Cloud?
sort_order: 2760

This template is referred to in the video 8.1b [Setting up the Environment on Saturn Cloud](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/blob/master/08-deep-learning/01b-saturn-cloud.md)

but the location shown in the video is no longer correct.

This template has been moved to “python deep learning tutorials’ which is shown on the Saturn Cloud home page.

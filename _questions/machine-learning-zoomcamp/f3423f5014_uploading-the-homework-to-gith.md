This is my first time using Github to upload a code. I was getting the below error message when I type

git push -u origin master:

error: src refspec master does not match any

error: failed to push some refs to '[https://github.com/XXXXXX/1st-Homework.git](https://github.com/XXXXXX/1st-Homework.git)'

Solution:

The error message got fixed by running below commands:

git commit -m "initial commit"

git push origin main

If this is your first time to use Github, you will find a great & straightforward tutorial in this link [https://dennisivy.com/github-quickstart](https://dennisivy.com/github-quickstart)

You can also use the “upload file” functionality from GitHub for that

If you write your code on Google colab you can also directly share it on your Github.

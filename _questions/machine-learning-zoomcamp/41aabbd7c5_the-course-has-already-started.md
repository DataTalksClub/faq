Yes, you can. Even though you missed the start date, you can register for the course. You wonâ€™t be able to submit some of the homeworks, but you can still take part in the course.

In order to get a certificate, you need to submit 2 out of 3 course projects and review 3 peers by the deadline. It means that if you join the course at the end of November and manage to work on two projects, you will still be eligible for a certificate.

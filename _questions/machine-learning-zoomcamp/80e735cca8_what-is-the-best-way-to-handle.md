You can handle missing values by:

Imputing the missing values with the mean, median, or mode.

Using algorithms that support missing values inherently (e.g., some tree-based methods).

Removing rows or columns with missing data, depending on the extent of missingness. Feature engineering might also help derive new features from incomplete dataâ€‹

data_corr = pd.DataFrame(data_num.corr().round(3).abs().unstack().sort_values(ascending=False))

data_corr.head(10)

You can also use seaborn to create a heatmap with the correlation. The code for doing that:

sns.heatmap(df[numerical_features].corr(),

annot=True,

square=True,

fmt=".2g",

cmap="crest")

Added by Cecile Guillot

You can refine your heatmap and plot only a triangle, with a blue to red color gradient, that will show every correlation between your numerical variables without redundant information with this function:

Which outputs, in the case of churn dataset:

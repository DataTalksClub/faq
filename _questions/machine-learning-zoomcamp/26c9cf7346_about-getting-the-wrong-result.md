When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.

For example:

A (m x n) * B (n x p) = C (m x p)

B (n x p) * A (m x n) = D (n x n)

C and D are matrices of different sizes and usually have different values. Therefore the order is important in matrix multiplication and changing the order changes the result.

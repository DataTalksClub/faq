Problem: When I am trying to pull the image with the docker pull svizor/zoomcamp-model command I am getting an error:

Using default tag: latestError response from daemon: manifest for svizor/zoomcamp-model:latest not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown

Solution: The docker by default uses the latest tag to avoid this use the correct tag from image description. In our case use command:

docker pull svizor/zoomcamp-model:3.10.12-slim

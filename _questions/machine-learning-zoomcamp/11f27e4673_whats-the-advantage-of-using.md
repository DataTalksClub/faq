Gunicorn is a Python WSGI HTTP server that is more suitable for production than the default Flask development server:

Performance:

Better at handling multiple simultaneous requests.

Stability:

More robust and can manage worker processes.

Usage:

Modify the CMD in your Dockerfile:CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:9696", "app:app"]

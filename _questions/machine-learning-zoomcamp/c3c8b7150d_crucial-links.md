What to do and Deliverables

Think of a problem that's interesting for you and find a dataset for that

Describe this problem and explain how a model could be used

Prepare the data and doing EDA, analyze important features

Train multiple models, tune their performance and select the best model

Export the notebook into a script

Put your model into a web service and deploy it locally with Docker

Bonus points for deploying the service to the cloud

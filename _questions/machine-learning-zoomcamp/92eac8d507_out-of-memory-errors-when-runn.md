I found this code snippet fixed my OOM errors, as I have an Nvidia GPU. Can't speak to OOM errors on CPU, though.

[https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/config/experimental/set_memory_growth](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/config/experimental/set_memory_growth)

```

physical_devices = tf.configlist_physical_devices('GPU')

try:

tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(physical_devices[0],True)

except:

# Invalid device or cannot modify virtual devices once initialized.

pass

```

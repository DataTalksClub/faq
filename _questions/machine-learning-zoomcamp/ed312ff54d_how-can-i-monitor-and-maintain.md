To monitor Lambda deployments, use AWS CloudWatch to access detailed logs, metrics, and alarms. Metrics like invocation count, duration, error rate, and memory usage can help diagnose performance issues. Use AWS X-Ray for tracing requests and analyzing latency. For model maintenance, set up an automated CI/CD pipeline to retrain models on updated data and redeploy using tools like Amazon SageMaker or custom workflows. Regularly evaluate model performance with a monitoring service to detect drift in predictions or data quality issues.

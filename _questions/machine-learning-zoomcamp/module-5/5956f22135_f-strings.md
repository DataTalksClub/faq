question: 'f-strings: f-String not properly keyed in. Does anyone know why I am getting
  an error after importing pickle?'

The first error occurred because your f-string is using `()` instead of `{}` around `C`. It should be:

```python
f'model_C={C}.bin'
```

The second error, as noticed, is missing a parenthesis. It should be:

```python
pickle.dump((dv, model), f_out)
```

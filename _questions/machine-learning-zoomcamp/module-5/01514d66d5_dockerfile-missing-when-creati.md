question: 'Docker: Dockerfile missing when creating the AWS ElasticBean environment'
sort_order: 2280
---



I encountered this error when creating an AWS ElasticBean environment using the command:

```bash
eb create tumor-diagnosis-env
```

**Error Message:**

```bash
ERROR   Instance deployment: Both 'Dockerfile' and 'Dockerrun.aws.json' are missing in your source bundle. Include at least one of them. The deployment failed.
```

**Solution:**

The error occurred because I had not committed the files used to build the container, particularly the `Dockerfile`. After performing the following Git operations, the command worked properly:

1. Add the modified files to staging:
   
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. Commit the changes:
   
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add Dockerfile and necessary files"
   ```

### Additional Issue:

When creating and launching an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment with `eb create`, you might encounter the following error:

**Error Message:**

```bash
ERROR: CommandError - git could not find the HEAD; most likely because there are no commits present
```

**Explanation and Steps to Resolve:**

This error indicates that your project directory has not been initialized as a Git repository or is in a "detached HEAD" state. Elastic Beanstalk's CLI relies on Git for managing application versions. Here's how to resolve it:

1. **Check Git Initialization:**
   - Run:
     
     ```bash
     git status
     ```

   - If Git is not initialized, you will see an error or a message indicating no repository exists.

2. **Initialize Git:**
   
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Create an Initial Commit (if none exists):**
   
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. **Manage "Detached HEAD" State:**
   - Create a new branch (if needed):
     
     ```bash
     git checkout -b main
     ```

   - Or switch to an existing branch:
     
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     ```

5. **Reinitialize Elastic Beanstalk (if necessary):**
   
   ```bash
   eb init
   ```

6. **Retry Deployment:**
   
   ```bash
   eb create <env_name> --enable-spot
   ```

Q: Hii folks, I tried deploying my docker image on Render, but it won't I get SIGTERM everytime.

I think .5GB RAM is not enough, is there any other free alternative available ?

A: aws (amazon), gcp (google), saturn.

Both aws and gcp give microinstance for free for a VERY long time, and a bunch more free stuff.

Saturn even provides free GPU instances. Recent promo link from mlzoomcamp for Saturn:

“You can sign up here: [https://bit.ly/saturn-mlzoomcamp](https://bit.ly/saturn-mlzoomcamp)

When you sign up, write in the chat box that you're an ML Zoomcamp student and you should get extra GPU hours (something like 150)”

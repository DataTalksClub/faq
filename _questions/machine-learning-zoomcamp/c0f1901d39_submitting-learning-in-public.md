When you post about what you learned from the course on your social media pages, use the tag #mlzoomcamp. When you submit your homework, there’s a section in the form for putting the links there. Separate multiple links by any whitespace character (linebreak, space, tab, etc).

For posting the learning in public links, you get extra scores. But the number of scores is limited to 7 points: if you put more than 7 links in your homework form, you’ll get only 7 points.

The same content can be posted to 7 different social sites and still earn you 7 points if you add 7 URLs per week, see . (~ ellacharmed)

For midterms/capstones, the awarded points are doubled as the duration is longer. So for projects the points are capped at 14 for 14 URLs.

Problem:

I created a new environment in SaturnCloud and chose the image corresponding to Saturn with Tensorflow, but when I tried to fit the model it showed an error about the missing module: scipy

Solution:

Install the module in a new cell: !pip install scipy

Restart the kernel and fit the model again

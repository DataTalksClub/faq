Problem: Max_depth is not recognize even when I add the mlflow.log_params

Solution: the mlflow.log_params(params) should be added to the hpo.py script, but if you run it it will append the new model to the previous run that doesnâ€™t contain the parameters, you should either remove the previous experiment or change it

When you set up your account you are automatically assigned a random name such as “Lucid Elbakyan” for example. Click on the Jump to your record on the leaderboard link to find your entry.

If you want to see what your Display name is, click on the Edit Course Profile button.

First field is your nickname/displayed-name, change it if you want to be known as your Slack username or Github username or whatever nickname if you want to remain anonymous

Unless you want “Lucid Elbakyan” on your certificate, it is mandatory that you change the second field to your official name as in your identification documents - passport, national ID card, driver’s license, etc. This is the name that is going to appear on your Certificate!

If some dependencies are missing

![Image](images/mlops-zoomcamp/image_7c6ef087.png)

Install following packages

pandas

matplotlib

scikit-learn

fastparquet

pyarrow

seaborn

pip install -r [requirements.txt](https://github.com/CodeProcessor/mlops-zoomcamp-notes/blob/main/01-Intro/homework/requirements.txt)

I have seen this error when using pandas.read_parquet(), the solution is to install pyarrow or fastparquet by doing !pip install pyarrow in the notebook

NOTE: if you’re using Conda instead of pip, install fastparquet rather than pyarrow, as it is much easier to install and it’s functionally identical to pyarrow for our needs.

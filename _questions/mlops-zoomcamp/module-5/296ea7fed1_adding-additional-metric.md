question: Adding additional metric

Problem description

Getting “target columns” “prediction columns” not present errors after adding a metric

Solution description

Make sure to read through the documentation on what is required or optional when adding the metric. I added DatasetCorrelationsMetric which doesn’t require any parameters because the metric evaluates for correlations among the features.

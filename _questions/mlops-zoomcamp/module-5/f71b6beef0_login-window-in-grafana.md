Problem description: When running docker-compose up as shown in the video 5.2 if you go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) you get asked for a username and a password.

Solution: for both of them the default is “admin”. Then you can enter your new password. See also [here ](https://datatalks-club.slack.com/archives/C02R98X7DS9/p1656776708650559)

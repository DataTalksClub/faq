question: The feature size is different for training set and validation set

While working through the HW1, you will realize that the training and the validation data set feature sizes are different. I was trying to figure out why and went down the entire rabbit hole only to see that I wasnâ€™t doing ```transform``` on the premade dictionary vectorizer instead of ```fit_transform```. You already have the dictionary vectorizer made so no need to execute the fit pipeline on the model.

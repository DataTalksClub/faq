To clarify on "Late homework submissions": we cannot submit after the homework is scored as the form is closed.

Once the form is closed (aka Scored), no further submissions are possible. So, then no "late homework submissions" allowed after the form is closed and not editable. You can check your code against the solution (check the homework.md) file.

If the due date has passed, but the form is still Open / Submitted, this is what I term "late homework submissions", the form is still editable. Donâ€™t forget to click the Update button with your changes!

So, we're on borrowed time and we have no way of knowing when Alexey would close the form (the process is still manual at this time).

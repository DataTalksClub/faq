A new version of Numpy has just been released v 2.0.0 (on Jun 16, 2024), and this causes an import error of the package.

"`np.chararray` is deprecated and will be removed from "

419     "the main namespace in the future. Use an array with a string "

420     "or bytes dtype instead.", DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2): `np.float_` was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release. Use `np.float64` instead.

Or

AttributeError: `np.float_` was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release. Use `np.float64` instead.

You can solve it by reinstalling numpy to previous version 1.26.4. Just run:

python -m pip install numpy==1.26.4

Or modify the requirements.txt to freeze the version:

numpy==1.26.4

Problem: Grafarna and Adminer not showing at their designated URIs after Docker Compose

Solution: If you are using a VM, you will have to forward the ports (on VS Code or any other editor)

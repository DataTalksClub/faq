You might need to use the green taxi data rather than yellow taxi data - look at other recent questions similar to yours. The preprocessing code provided with the homework expects green taxi data (even though the question specifies yellow taxi data), and answers seem to confirm that using green taxi data is the way to go. Not that there's no official confirmation of this though (as of early morning, May 27th in Berlin).

question: Homework and Leaderboard - what is the system for points in the course management
  platform?
sort_order: 230

After you submit your homework it will be graded based on the amount of questions in a particular homework. You can see how many points you have right on the page of the homework up top. Additionally in the leaderboard you will find the sum of all points youâ€™ve earned - points for Homeworks, FAQs and Learning in Public. If homework is clear, others work as follows: if you submit something to FAQ, you get one point, for each learning in a public link you get one point. Hover over the ? for some explanations.

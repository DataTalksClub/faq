It really depends on how much time and effort you can dedicate to the project over the coming weeks. Since you're late for the homeworks and they aren't required for the certificate, it might make sense to throw yourself into the projects - even if the first attempt is a struggle, it will be the best preparation for the second attempt, should you need (or feel like) one.

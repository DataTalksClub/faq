question: Course - How do I start?
sort_order: 50

No matter if you're with a 'live' cohort or follow on the self-paced mode, the way to start is similar:

see what things are where by reading  pins and  bookmarks on the course-channel

<{IMAGE:image_1}>

<{IMAGE:image_2}>

reading the repo (bookmarked in channel) and watching the video lessons (playlist bookmarked in channel)

if have questions, search the channel itself first; someone may have already asked and gotten a solution

if don't want to comb through the search results, read  for the most Frequently Asked Questions (this document)

<{IMAGE:image_3}>

if don't even want to read/skim/search (use ctrl+F) the questions in FAQ doc, tag the @ZoomcampQABot when you ask questions, and it will summarize it for you (if answers in its knowledge-base)

For generic, non-zoomcamp queries, you can also ask ChatGPT/BingCopilot/GoogleGemini/etc, especially for error messages

check if you're on track by checking the deadlines (in Course Management form for Homework submissions)

main difference of not being in a “live” cohort is that the responses to your questions might be delayed as not many active students come online anymore. Which is not an issue if you do your own due diligence and search for answers first or reading the documentation of the library.

If you do need to ask questions when no answers supplied in resources above have helped, follow the asking-questions.md (bookmarked in channel) guidelines, also in Pins…

The course videos are pre-recorded, you can start watching the course right now.

The zoomcamps are spread out throughout the year. See article [https://datatalks.club/blog/guide-to-free-online-courses-at-datatalks-club.html](https://datatalks.club/blog/guide-to-free-online-courses-at-datatalks-club.html)

We will also occasionally have office hours - live sessions where we will answer your questions. The office hours sessions are recorded too.

You can see the office hours (playlist with year 20xx) as well as the pre-recorded course videos in (playlist without year) in Course Channel’s Bookmarks and/or [DTC’s youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DataTalksClub/playlists)

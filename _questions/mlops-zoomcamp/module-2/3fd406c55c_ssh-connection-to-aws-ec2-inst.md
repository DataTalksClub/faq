question: SSH Connection to AWS EC2 instance from local machine WSL getting terminated
  frequently within a minute of inactivity.
sort_order: 990

If the ssh connection from your local machineâ€™s WSL to AWS EC2 instance is frequently getting terminated with very short span of inactivity with the following message displayed at prompt:

<{IMAGE:image_1}>

You can fix the same by adding the following lines to your config file at your .ssh directory in your WSL environment:

ServerAliveInterval 60

ServerAliveCountMax 3

For eg (for clarity). after adding these lines your ssh connection should look somewhat like this below:

Host mlops-zoomcamp

HostName 45.80.32.7

User ubuntu

IdentityFile ~/.ssh/siddMLOps.pem

StrictHostKeyChecking no

ServerAliveInterval 60

ServerAliveCountMax 3

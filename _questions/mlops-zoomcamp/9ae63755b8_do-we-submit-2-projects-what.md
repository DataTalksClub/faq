You only need to submit 1 project. If the submission at the first attempt fails, you can improve it and re-submit during attempt#2 submission window.

If you want to submit 2 projects for the experience and exposure, you must use different datasets and problem statements.

If you canâ€™t make it to the attempt#1 submission window, you still have time to catch up to meet the attempt#2 submission window

Remember that the submission does not count towards the certification if you do not participate in the peer-review of 3 peers in your cohort

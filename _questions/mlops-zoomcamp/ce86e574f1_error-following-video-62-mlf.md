When following the video instructions and running the Dockerfile I get an error that the Dockerfile build failed in line 8, because there is no matching distribution for mlflow=1.27.0. Below is the code output:

4.900 ERROR: No matching distribution found for mlflow==1.27.0

4.901 ERROR: Couldn't install package: {}
